A few weeks ago I was invited to speak to students at a university in Tirana. After thinking about what could be of some impact on the lives of people who are going to get into the labor market soon I decided to talk to them about what my life had been, in the hope to give them some pointers on what to repeat and what to avoid.

You can get a [copy of the slides here](./CreatingDreams.odp) and [watch the recording we did on youtube](https://youtu.be/JFnpjQYGUJk). I also wrote a blog post about it which you [can read here](https://joebordes.com/the-danger-of-finding-your-purpose-and-passion).

Thanks Ksandra for thinking about me for that and inviting me. It was an honor and a pleasure.

Thanks Desi for helping and recording.
