The **coreBOS Certification Program** is divided into three parts:

-   **User Level:** which teaches you to fully understand and use all
    parts of the application as a user.
-   **Administrator/Implementor Level:** which teaches you to configure
    and adapt the application to the needs of the users.
-   **Developer Level:** which teaches you how to use coreBOS as a
