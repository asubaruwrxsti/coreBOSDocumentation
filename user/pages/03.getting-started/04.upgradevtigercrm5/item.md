Upgrade from vtiger CRM 5.4.0 to coreBOS using coreBOS Updater
==============================================================

-   make a copy of your database
-   get a copy of the latest version of coreBOS and copy it into a
    subdirectory on your server
    -   download the code from [the download button on
        github](https://github.com/tsolucio/corebos/archive/master.zip)
        or MUCH BETTER, clone the repository
        `git clone https://github.com/tsolucio/corebos`
-   copy from your current install:
    -   storage
    -   test/logo
    -   user\_privileges (overwrite any existing files)
    -   config.inc.php
    -   and any non standard modules that you may have:
        -   for example, PDFMaker would require that you copy:
            -   modules/PDFMaker
            -   Smarty/templates/PDFMaker
        -   if you have others, then you copy their directories
-   edit config.inc.php
    -   change the database access to point to the database copy and
        $site\_url and $root\_directory accordingly
-   <s>edit vtigerversion.php and change the version to 5.4</s>
-   copy build/HelperScripts/installupdater.php to the root of your
    install and execute it:
    `http://your_server/your_install/installupdater.php`
-   now log in as admin to make sure you are working ok: you can log in
    and the initial home page appears
-   go to coreBOS updater
-   click on "Load Updates"
-   click on "Apply All". Note that you may have to do this a few times
    to get all the changes applied as there are some dependencies. Also
    there will be some SQL errors because we have a set of changes that
    cover many different cases and your install is different for sure.

you are done! you should be on the latest version of coreBOS
