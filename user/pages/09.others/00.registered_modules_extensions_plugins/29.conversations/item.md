Conversations
=============

The Conversations module is similar to the native comments module in
coreBOS but is intended to save large conversations that take place
outside the application. For example, a hangout, skype or whatsapp
dialog or a whole email thread that needs to be recorded in the
application. When a conversation record is created a comment is
automatically added to all related records with a link to the
conversation, so just looking at the comments on the account you will
see the conversation that took place and will be able to easily click to
read the whole context.  
The main goal is to save large conversations/comments without making
navigating an account record uncomfortable.
