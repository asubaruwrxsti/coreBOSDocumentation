<div class="notices blue">
<h2>I define a profile where I deactivate the top options of see and use
all and then all the modules except Accounts, Contacts and Leads.</h2>

Then I go to any Lead but the Convert Lead action is not there. Why?

I can only see the link if I activate see and use all, but then I also
see al the modules, which I do not want.</div>

!!! I just tried and it worked correctly for me.

!!! The problem must be with some field the conversion needs. I had a look at the code and it says that the "Convert Lead" action will be visible when all these conditions are met:

-   the user has edit permission on Accounts, Contacts and Leads
-   the user must have conversion tool permission in his profile (see
    image below)
-   Accounts and Contacts modules are active
-   the Lead hasn't been converted previously
-   the field "Company" on the lead is not empty
