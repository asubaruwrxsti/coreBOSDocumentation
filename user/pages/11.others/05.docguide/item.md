The wiki is divided into some top level categories like [User Manual](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/user-manual) and [Administrator Manual](adminmanual). Each of
these is divided into four additional categories:

-   **Tutorials**: These teach your users specific things that they can
    do with the application, and are usually tightly focused on just a
    few pieces of functionality. Bonus points if you include working
    sample code.
-   **Guides**: This is somewhere between the reference and tutorials.
    It should be like your reference with prose that explains how to use
    the application.
-   **Reference**: This is the listing of all the functionality in
    excruciating detail. This includes all datatype and function
    specifications.
-   **FAQ**: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers

There are some top level special categories like
[Installation](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/getting-started) and [HelpMeNow]() for the
application inline help.
