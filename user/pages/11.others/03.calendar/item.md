How to add an activity or event
-------------------------------

There are several approaches on how to add a new activity, event or
to-do:

-   directly from Calendar View (recommended) - the order is the same
    for Day, Week or Month view and is described below – the advantage
    of this approach is that start date and time are automatically
    defined by your selection and you can easily see whether the time
    slot is empty for your activity as well as invited colleagues
-   using **Add event** button
-   using action buttons \[Add Event\], \[Add To Do\] from records of
    the modules like Contacts, Organizations

The recommended and quick approach is using Calendar View. It allows
creating activities directly from the Day, Week or Month view for any
particular time. In order to add new activity:

-   Switch to Day, Week or Month view according to your needs.
-   Click on the Calendar View to select start time of your activity.
-   Select activity type (Call, Meeting, etc).
-   The new window “Add Event” (for Call, Meeting, etc.) or “Create To
    Do” (for tasks) will appear on the screen.
-   Fill in the form fields and save it using the \[Save\] button.

Calendar View
-------------

The Calendar View has several possibilities to be adjusted according to
your needs and provides new functionalities. The following two pictures
present some of CalendarView functions:

-   Calls, meetings, invites and other activities are represented by
    rectangular areas which cover places with respect to real start/end
    time of the activities. You can easily drag and drop activities,
    simply extend end time or easily to switch to Edit View or Detail
    View of the activities.
-   Tasks/To Dos are shown in the Calendar View as well, at the top part
    “all-day” section.
-   Day, Week and Month calendar are provided. Just click on the buttons
    to change the view.
-   Quick navigation buttons can be used to select a date.
-   User Settings – deals with Time settings, Calendar sharing and
    [Google authentication](/en/calendar_google_integration).
-   Module manager settings – profile privileges.
-   Add new activity button (It opens a new window to create new
    activity for current day).
-   Within Activity List panel you can easily show/hide different types
    of activities. In addition you can define colors, displayed
    information and set up [Google
    synchronization](/en/calendar_google_integration). As you can see in
    the next image, the activities are shown in colors in case you are
    viewing only activities assigned to one user.

with this Calendar is viewing your invites.&lt;/WRAP&gt;

-   The panel “Assigned To” is used to show/hide activities for more
    users on the calendar or just to see other user activities. In this
    case the colors are used to easily distinguish activities of the
    corresponding user.
-   Using checkboxes you can easily select users of the group of
    interest. Another advantage is that the selected group is remembered
    under “All selected” value and can be used again when you access the
    system again.
-   Using checkboxes of the panel “Event status” you can show/hide
    events based on their status.
-   Using checkboxes of the panel “Task status” you can show/hide tasks
    based on their status.

Calendar Settings
-----------------

The Calendar settings consist of:

    panel

### Calendar View settings

There are some additional settings related to Calendar View which can be

below. The Calendar View settings consist of the following tabs:

#### Colors in calendar

On the Calendar View we can use different colors. The intention is to
provide a better overview by using different colors for single activity
types or users depending on the current view. In addition you can select
your own color for a single activity/user.

In order to select the color, initiate the Calendar View settings and
follow these simple steps:

-   Go to “Colors in calendar” tab and click on the icon.
-   Select the color.
-   Save the settings using the \[Save\] button.

#### Displayed information

The "Displayed information" tab allows you to define how much
information is displayed in Calendar View for all single views
separately, i.e. for day calendar, week calendar as well as month
calendar. In addition you can define displayed information separately
for each activity type.

The use of this tab is simple. In order to view the more information
fields available, select them from “Available informations” and click on
the \[Add &gt;&gt;\] button. You can see the default field which will be
used on the top of the selected fields (marked purple in the following
picture).

Frequently Asked Question
-------------------------

~~QNA~~

??? Hour is not the same in the calendar and email. Using a workflow
that sends an email to the contact, with meeting time and date (variable
existing in the event), there is a one hour difference between email
received and event in agenda.

!!! The email is sent in the timezone of the assigned user. Look at this
example

This is the workflow email:

<img src="/en/calendartz1.png" class="align-center" alt="Workflow Email template" />

The coreBOS install I am testing on is set to UTC in config.inc.php. I
create a calendar to-do with a user in the UTC timezone with the start
date at 2020-12-16 22:24 to 2020-12-16 22:29. With the record assigned
to this same user (UTC) I see this email:

<img src="/en/calendartzutc.png" class="align-center" alt="Email UTC" />

With a user in UTC+1 I get this one:

<img src="/en/calendartzutcp1.png" class="align-center" alt="Email UTC+1" />

and with a user in UTC-3 I get:

<img src="/en/calendartzutcm3.png" class="align-center" alt="Email UTC-3" />
