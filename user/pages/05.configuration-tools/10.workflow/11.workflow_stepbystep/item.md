The Workflow module provides a number of options to trigger actions
based on events in the application or time based events.

To configure a workflow for a module enter the application as an admin
user, go to the *Settings* page and click on the *Workflows* link (this
can be found under the *Other Settings* block)

![](step1mw.png?width=80%)

This will bring up the list of all defined workflows (by default all
workflows are listed).

You can see all the available workflow for any particular module using
the *Select Module* dropdown on the page.

![](step2mw.png?width=80%)

The Workflow extension provides options to

    *create a new workflow 
    *edit an existing workflow 
    *delete an existing workflow

Create Workflow
---------------

Click on the *New Workflow* button. A popup will appear listing the
available modules.

![](step3mw.png?width=80%)

Select a module and click *Create*. You will be taken to an edit page
for the workflow.

Add a Description for the workflow. You can specify here [when the workflow should run](../10.workflow_launch_conditions).

![](step4mw.png?width=80%)

You can [add more conditions](../08.workflow_conditions) by clicking the
*New Condition* button.

![](step5mw.png?width=80%)

Click the 'Save' Button to save the new workflow.

Once you have saved the workflow, you will be presented with a screen
where you can add the tasks for the workflow. These task(s) will be
executed once the workflow conditions are satisfied.

Create tasks
------------

Click on the *New Task* button to add a new task. You will get a popup
to select the type of task you can create. There are multiple types of
tasks, among which you may find:

    *//Send Email// task which can be used to send emails
    *//Invoke custom function// task which will call certain specific methods on the entity objects.
    *//Create Todo// task which will create a todo when the workflow condition is met. 
    *//Create Event// task, which will create an event.

Select a task type from the dropdown and click on the create button to
create the task.

Configuring tasks
-----------------

### Common Fields

The following fields are common for all workflow tasks

    *//Task Title// - This is the title of the task used in the task list to identify the task. 
    *//Status// - This is a selection box which should be set to active if the task is to be executed when the workflow executes. 
    *//Execute the task after some delay// - If this is checked you will be provided with additional fields to specify a time delay for when the task will be executed. You can specify when the task is executed relative to the time in a date field on the record.

### Email Task

### Invoke custom function

This option provides a way for developers to [add module specific actions to workflows](../03.invokecustomfunction_workflows). To define a
task, you need to define a method to be called. This method should be
defined as a function in it's own file.

    <?php
    function demo($entity){
        $entity->focus->called = true;
    }
    ?>

The method then needs to be registered, for example if the method was
defined in the file modules/demo/Demo.inc for the Contacts module and
given the name method.

    require_once 'include/utils/utils.php';
    require 'modules/com_vtiger_workflow/VTEntityMethodManager.inc';
    $emm = new VTEntityMethodManager($adb);
    $emm->addEntityMethod("PurchaseOrder", "method", "modules/Workflow/Demo.inc", "demo");

The method will appear in the list of methods available for the Contacts
module.

### Todo Task

Using this option, you can setup a workflow to create a new calendar
Todo when a condition is matched. The following fields are provided in
the create view of this option

    *Todo - The title of the todo. 
    *Description - Of the todo. 
    *Status - The status of the todo, can be selected from the dropdown 
    *Priority - The priority of the todo, can be selected from the dropdown. 
    *Time - The start time of the todo, in 24 hours time. 
    *Due Date - The due date for the todo, the start date is also set using this. 
    *Send Notification - Set the send notification flag.

If the module which triggers the workflow is Contacts then the *Contact
Name* field will be bound to the contact. If the module is one of the
acceptable modules for the Related To field then the module *Related To*
field will be bound to the module.

### Event Task

This is same as Todo task other than that it creates an event instead of
a task.
