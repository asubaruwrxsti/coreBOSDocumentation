### Great, so do I really need a CLA?

By far, not every project needs a CLA and the small bureaucracy
overhead.

My advice is that you use a CLA for any project that meets these
conditions:

1.  you expect the project to be long-lived,
2.  you develop this project as part of your work,
3.  you expect contributions from third-party organizations.

Otherwise, use your gut feeling. &lt;/WRAP&gt;

Annotated](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/1.1/annotated/): &lt;WRAP center
round box 60%&gt; We believe wholeheartedly in the benefits of open
source development, but not everyone does. Some people or groups may try
to take advantage of the work of open source development through claims
of patent infringement. This is unfortunate, but it is also reality. We
suggest that you be aware of the intellectual property implications of
what you are working on to protect yourself and others from falling
afoul of someone else's patent. &lt;/WRAP&gt;

-----------

We should be imposing a CLA

-   because we are serious abut this and plan to be here a long time
-   because we want to protect our users and contributors
-   because we want to protect our project
-   because it is the right thing to do
