Calendar Development
====================

Integrate Custom Modules
------------------------

For a custom module to be correctly supported in the Calendar module it
must register itself by creating a few records in two tables.

### Module Fields Definitions

This table indicates the base start and end date fields and a comma
separated list of fields to show in the popup summary box.

The table is *its4you\_calendar\_modulefields* and you can see an
example looking at the code we use to fill in this table for the default
modules (build/changeSets/ModulesOnCalendar.php).

### Module Status Definitions

This table indicates the search conditions to be used when filtering
records on the calendar.

You can give search conditions for three status:

-   **Planned**
-   **Held**
-   **Not Held**

The table is *its4you\_calendar\_modulestatus* and you can see an
example looking at the code we use to fill in this table for the default
modules (build/changeSets/ModulesOnCalendar.php).

Timezone tests
--------------

In order to verify timezone on the calendar with DST changes I did this
test. With the computer unconnected to the internet and set to
mid-October, I create 18 calendar events, 6 for each of 3 users. The 6
events are 3 before DST change and 3 after the change. The 3 users are
on UTC-3, UTC+1 (DST) and UTC. The database is set to UTC which is how
it should be always.

This looks like this:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td>testtz-3</td>
<td>testtz</td>
<td>testymd</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>UTC-3</td>
<td>UTC+1</td>
<td>UTC</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>15/10/17 10:00</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>15/10/17 23:30</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>16/10/17 00:30</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>04/11/17 10:00</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>04/11/17 23:30</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>05/11/17 00:30</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

I visually verify that all users see the events where they should
appear. I enter as an admin user and see all events of all 3 users
correctly situated by the timezone of the admin user.

Now I reboot the computer and set the date to the second of November in
the BIOS.

I access coreBOS and visually verify that all users see the events where
they should appear. I enter as an admin user and see all events of all 3
users correctly situated by the timezone of the admin user.

I create a Report on the events and verify that all three users see the
events correctly and that the admin user also sees them all correctly.

I verify that the detail view is also correct.

I create an event with repeat over the DST weekend and verify that all
events are created correctly.

I also verify that all the date information saved in the database is
correct.
