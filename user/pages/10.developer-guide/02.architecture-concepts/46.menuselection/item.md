Menu Selection
==============

coreBOS needs a better, more flexible menu system than what we inherited
from vtiger CRM. So we set out to look for some options with some of
these goals in mind:

-   Dropdown menu system fully configurable by the user
-   Multilevel sub-menus
-   Support for multiple types of menu actions: module, url, separator
-   Fast loading
-   CSS based, ideally responsive

[SkeLa-](https://github.com/SkeLa-) has contributed three menu options
for coreBOS. One based on KendoUI, anther based on JQuery and another
based on pure HTML5/CSS following [Lightning Design
System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com) guidelines.

I evaluated all three options and decided to incorporate the Lightning
Design System menu. There were basically three main reasons for this
decision:

1.  I really like how it looks: clean, simple, professional. LDS
    guidelines in general are VERY sane, very well thought out and I
    would like to recommend them in the whole application in due time,
    so seeing this menu system enforced my position on this point.
2.  I am currently in a mind set to stay away from libraries. I want to
    use pure HTML5, CSS and Javascript wherever possible
3.  Load timing. Being pure HTML5/CSS this menu just wins hands down on
    the other two.

So, as of the end of December 2016, coreBOS now has an advanced menu
system based on Lightning Design System.
