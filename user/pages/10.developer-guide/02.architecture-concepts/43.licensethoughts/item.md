My understanding of the License
===============================

-   Initial developer permits us to do whatever we want with the code:
    use it, sell it, rebrand it, modify it, but always under the same
    conditions of the license
-   Contributor permits us to do whatever we want with their
    MODIFICATIONS: use them, sell them, rebrand them, modify them, but
    always under the same conditions of the license
-   since both previous points impose that the user MUST not suffer any
    change in their liberties. This point makes it incompatible for the
    MODIFICATIONS to have a GPL license because the whole work would be
    affected
-   we HAVE THE OBLIGATION of giving ALL our MODIFICATIONS in source
    code, we can not encrypt them nor change their license
-   if we do a larger work, the VPL code described above cannot be
    restricted, in other words, anybody MUST have access to original
    code and ALL it's MODIFICATIONS
-   we MUST detail all code modifications
-   the code can be dual-lincesed but only vtiger can do that
-   "Modifications" This is a very important definition, as it specifies
    precisely what code you write must be made available and what you
    can keep proprietary.
    -   Anything termed a "Modification" must be made available in
        source code form to anyone to whom you give a binary. The
        following defines a Modification:
        -   If you change anything within one of the files contained in
            the Source Code, that is a Modification.
        -   If you take code out of one of the files contained in the
            Source Code and place it in a new file, whether you add new
            code or not, that is a Modification.
        -   If you rename a file or combine two or more files contained
            in the Source Code, that is a Modification.
