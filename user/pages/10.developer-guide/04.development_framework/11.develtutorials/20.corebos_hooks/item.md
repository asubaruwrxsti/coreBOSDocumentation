Explanation
-----------

coreBOS permits the implementor/developer to add functionality to the
existing application in three different ways: **Events**, **Links** and
**Hooks**.

**Events** occur at special points in the execution of the application
and the eventing system permits us to insert our own code and
functionality at these points, while **Hooks** permit us to enhance the
existing functionality of objects and modules as if the code had always
been there. The difference is very subtle and basically resides in the
way the developer's new code must be added for it to be functional. The
**Events** system requires the developer to create a new class that
extends the base event class, add the functionality to this class and
register it into the system for it to be called, while the **Hooks**
system will require adding specifically named functions and files to
certain places for it to be found and executed accordingly.

**Links** are a mix between Events and Hooks as they permit us to load
specific code as if it had always been there, including buttons and
links, but they require to be registered in the application to be
loaded.

As I have already said the difference between events and hooks is very
subtle, even some types of links are hard to distinguish from hooks. In
the end they are simply different ways of changing the default behavior
of the application and you need to choose which one you need depending
on the goal of your change.

If you read the [official definition of a hook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking) or a [webhook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), you can see that there
is really no distinction, they are all ways to change the behavior of
the application. coreBOS makes a distinction based on the way you insert
the hook into the application, in other words, depending on the steps
the programmer has to take to get the hook into the system. Looking at
it that way we have:

-   **Events**: require that you create a specific class and launch some
    specific code to register the new functionality
-   **Links**: require that you create a URL and register the action
    using some specific code
-   **Hooks**: require that you create some specific code and do some
    steps that do not fall into the previous two categories

So, in the end the only difference is how you insert your code into the
application depending on what you need to hook into.

EVENTS: Types and usage
-----------------------

When you want to extend coreBOS, you can use the event API, which
provides a simple way of adding actions without making any modification
to the base code files.

To add a new event handler, you will need to define a class that extends
the **VTEventHandler** abstract class. For example:
```php
    class SimpleHandler extends VTEventHandler{
     public function handleEvent($name, $data){
      global $log;
      $log->fatal("This handler has been called for the $name event and prints this message to the log file.");
     }
    }
```
Then you have to register the handler in the system with this code:
```php
    require 'include/events/include.inc';
    $em = new VTEventsManager($adb);
    $em->registerHandler($eventName, $filePath, $className);
```
this can be done in an individual one-shot script or added to the
**vtlib\_handler()** method to be executed when installing a new module
or extension.

The eventing system supports two types: **actions and filters**.

An **action** will be called to do some tasks without returning a value.
Actions use the **handleEvent($handlerType, $parameter)** method in the
Event class, which must exist.

A **filter** will be called to do some tasks and will return a value,
with which some action will be done in the application. Normally the
returned value will be the same $parameter with some modifications.
Filters use the **handleFilter($handlerType, $parameter)** method, which
will return the new $parameter value.

### Event Launching

Events are launched for ALL modules and executed ALWAYS.

That means that we must encapsulate or protect our event code inside a
condition that makes sure we are in the correct module. Looking at the
different examples you can see that almost all of them start with a

"*if ($moduleName=='whatever')*"

<div class="notices blue"> This is the "de facto" standard
</div>

It also means that we have to be especially careful with the things that
are done, our code has to be fast and efficient in order to not block
the user experience, and also resistant to errors.

Although this may seem an incorrect approach, experience shows that it
is extremely powerful for many situations.

That said, the "save" events (and some others) support conditions
directly in their definition and also dependency launching. These events
have a "condition" column and a "dependent on" column.

The **condition column** can accept expressions following this syntax:

    The accepted grammer is:
     *  comparision | inclause
     * where
     *   comparision is: SYMBOL == value
     *   inclause is: SYMBOL IN listelement
     *   listelement is: [ value (, value )* ]
     *   SYMBOL can be: (a fieldname) | moduleName | id

for example, we can use expressions like:

    moduleName in ['Contacts', 'Potentials']
    moduleName == 'Accounts'
    employees == '131'
    id == '74'
    rating in ['Active','Acquired']

The **dependent column** is a JSON encoded array of event handlers that
must be executed before the one being defined. So you can ask the system
to execute your event after some other event has finished.

### Supported events

<div class="notices blue"> Note that inside each event type the
set of active events will be executed in order of creation (sorted by
their eventid) as <a href="https://discussions.corebos.org/showthread.php?tid=1351">can be read here</a>.
</div>

#### vtiger.entity.beforesave.modifiable

This event is an internal event that is launched before any other event
when an entity is saved. It should not be used.

#### vtiger.entity.beforesave

This event is fired before an entity is saved. You will be passed a
**[VTEntityData](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/vtentitydata)** object representing the saved
entity. It should be noted that new objects may not have an id (if it is
being created). You can modify the contents of VTEntityObject.

#### vtiger.entity.beforesave.final

This event is an internal event that is launched after all other
BEFORESAVE events when an entity is saved. It should not be used.

#### vtiger.entity.aftersave.first

This event is fired after an entity is saved, but before workflows and
standard aftersave events but the local save\_module() method of the
object has been executed.

#### vtiger.entity.aftersave

This event is fired after an entity is saved, even the local
save\_module() method of the object has been executed. This also
provides a **[VTEntityData](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/vtentitydata)** object.

#### vtiger.entity.aftersave.final

This event is an internal event that is launched after all other SAVE
events have occurred. It should not be used.

#### vtiger.entity.beforedelete

This event is fired before an entity is deleted. You will be passed a
**[VTEntityData](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/vtentitydata)** object representing the
entity that will be eliminated.

#### vtiger.entity.afterdelete

This event is fired after an entity is deleted. You will be passed a
**[VTEntityData](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/vtentitydata)** object representing the
deleted object. Be careful as this object can no longer be referenced
using the applications' methods.

#### vtiger.entity.afterrestore

This event is fired after an entity has been recovered from the Recycle
Bin. You will be passed a **[VTEntityData](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/vtentitydata)**
object representing the entity that has been restored.

#### vtiger.entity.beforegroupdelete

This event is fired before deleting a group. You will be passed an array
with this structure:
```php
    array(
     'groupid' => $groupId; // Group Id to be deleted:: integer
     'transferToId' => $transferId; // Id of the group/user to which record ownership is to be transferred:: integer
    );
```
#### corebos.header.premenu

Will be triggered in the header of coreBOS, right after the announcement
marquee has been rendered and before the application menu. It supports a
generic way of sending some output before the menu.

This event does not receive any parameters.

#### corebos.header

Will be triggered in the header of coreBOS, right after the menu has
been rendered and before the call to the module to be loaded. It
supports a generic way of sending some output before any module output.

This event does not receive any parameters.

#### corebos.footer.prefooter

Will be triggered in the footer of coreBOS, right before calling the
code to output the default application footer.

This event does not receive any parameters.

#### corebos.footer

Will be triggered in the footer of coreBOS, when the whole execution has
ended. If the logged-in user is an admin user this event will be used to
print out a time execution summary of the events.

This event does not receive any parameters.

![](corebosheaderfooterhooks.png?width=100%)

#### corebos.popup.footer

Will be triggered in the footer of the coreBOS popup window when
capturing a record in a uitype 10 field, when the whole execution has
ended.

This event does not receive any parameters.

#### corebos.filter.listview.querygenerator.before

Will be triggered before QueryGenerator will be used to create the Query
for the List View Entries. It can be used to manipulate the
QueryGenerator, adding or eliminating fields to be used by the List
View.

This event receives $queryGenerator as a parameter and must return the
same object.

#### corebos.filter.listview.querygenerator.after

Will be triggered after QueryGenerator was used to create the Query for
the List View Entries. it can be used to manipulate the QueryGenerator,
adding or eliminating fields to be used by the List View.

This event receives $queryGenerator as a parameter and must return the
same object.

#### corebos.filter.listview.querygenerator.query

Will be triggered once the QueryGenerator has completely finished and
will receive the generated query as a string, so it can be manipulated.
Using this event you could override the result of the QueryGenerator.

This event receives $list\_query as a parameter and must return the same
object.

#### corebos.filter.listview.render

Will be triggered at the end of every List View Entry (row in the table)
generation and receives the final HTML code of every column in one row.
Could be used to manipulate the HTML of each column inside List View

Receives an array with three elements of the current row:

<table class="table table-striped">
<th>$parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>$columnHtml</td>
<td>html of the content of every column (Not the &lt;td&gt; itself)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>$row</td>
<td>complete Fetch of the Row from DB Query</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>$recordID</td>
<td>associated recordID of this row</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### corebos.filter.listview.header

Will be triggered at the end of the creation of the List View table
header (header row in the table) and receives the final HTML code of
every column in the header row. Could be used to manipulate the HTML of
each column inside the header or for adding a new column header

#### corebos.filter.listview.filter.show

This event will be called for each filter to be shown in the list view
filters picklist. It will receive an array with the full details of the
filter to be loaded and expects a boolean (True/False) response that
will indicate if the filter is to be added to the picklist or not.

#### corebos.filter.editview.setObjectValues

This event will be called when a new record is being created. It will
receive the new CRMEntity object so you can add default values to any
field using the column\_field property. Obviously, you could do other
verification or functionality tasks.

You must return the object given.

<div class="notices blue">
The <a href="https://github.com/tsolucio/coreBOSAddress"><i>coreBOSAddress</i></a>
module has an exceptional example of how this works by filling in the address
fields when creating a new record from its related list.</div>

#### corebos.filter.link.show

This event will be called for each Link to be loaded in the application.
It will receive an array with the full details of the link to be loaded
and expects a boolean (True/False) response that will indicate if the
link is to be added or not.

#### corebos.filter.ModComments.canAdd

This event must return a true or false value and will be called in three
parts of the application:

-   showing the ModComments widget on the detail view of a record. If
    false is returned the user will not be able to see the add widget
    section
-   when saving a comment via the detail view widget. If false is
    returned the comment will not be created
-   when saving a comment in the module. If false is returned an error
    message will be shown on screen and the comment will not be created

#### corebos.filter.ModComments.queryCriteria

This event will be called when constructing the SQL query to retrieve
the comments associated with a record. We must return a part of the
*WHERE* condition that modifies the final query.

#### corebos.entity.link.before

Action launched BEFORE two entities are about to be related. The action
receives the names and IDs of the records being related.

#### corebos.entity.link.after

Action launched AFTER two entities have been related. The action
receives the names and IDs of the records being related.

#### corebos.entity.link.delete

Action launched when two entities are about to be UNrelated (BEFORE).
The action receives the names and IDs of the records being UNrelated.

#### corebos.entity.link.delete.final

Action launched when two entities have just been UNrelated (AFTER). The
action receives the names and IDs of the records being UNrelated.

#### corebos.filter.preSaveCheck

Filter launched before starting the Save process. Will receive, the
$\_REQUEST variable and the current object trying to be saved. It must
return, besides these two input parameters, an error status, an error
message, an error action and an array of variables to return to the edit
screen the process was initiated from. 

[You can read a little more about this filterhere](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/precrud)

#### corebos.filter.preEditCheck

Filter launched before starting the Edit process. Will receive, the
$\_REQUEST variable, the Smarty object and the current object trying to
be edited.

[You can read a little more about this filter here](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/precrud)

#### corebos.filter.preViewCheck

Filter launched before starting the Detail View process. Will receive,
the $\_REQUEST variable, the Smarty object and the current object trying
to be viewed.

[You can read a little more about this filter here](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/precrud)

#### corebos.filter.preDeleteCheck

Filter launched before deleting a record. Will receive, the current
object trying to be deleted and must return a boolean indicating if the
action may proceed or not and a message to show in case it cannot.

[You can read a little more about this filter
here](/en/devel/corebos_hooks/precrud)

#### corebos.audit.\[authenticate|login|login.attempt|logout|action\]

Actions called on the indicated events

#### corebos.filter.inventory.getprice

When the application requires a product/service price, it will get the
unit price field from the database and then call this filter with some
information so we can calculate some other price to be returned.

This filter receives these parameters:

-   the unit price
-   the discount (always 0 as the application does not natively
    calculate this)
-   an array with these values:
    -   inventory module we are on
    -   module id if we are editing
    -   accountid (maybe 0 if not selected)
    -   contactid (maybe 0 if not selected)
    -   productid/serviceid
    -   related\_module

#### corebos.filter.announcement

return the announcement to show. permits creating dynamic announcements

### Custom Permission Hooks

**corebos.permission.\[accessquery|ispermitted\]**: [Custom Permission Hooks](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/corebos_permission_hooks)

### Events Examples

When you register an event in the application the details are saved in
the **vtiger\_eventhandlers** table, so the best way to find examples of
the different types of events above is to look in that table for real
working code. For example, you can find there:

HOOKS: Types and usage
----------------------

Each hook requires its' own specific magic and steps to get them working
and cover different aspects of functionality enhancement.

-   [Popup open hook](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/popup_open_hook)
-   [Popup capture hook](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/popup_capture_hook)
-   [Popup query hook](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/popup_query_hook)
-   [Related List hook](http://localhost/coreBOSDocumentation/developer-guide/architecture-concepts/related_list_hook)
-   afterImportRecord

LINKS: Types and usage
----------------------

**Links** permit us to add buttons and action links and also to load
javascript and CSS into the application.

To register these actions into coreBOS we use the vtlib API interface
**addLink()** method:

    include_once('vtlib/Vtiger/Module.php');
    $moduleInstance = Vtiger_Module::getInstance('ModuleName');
    $moduleInstance->addLink(<LinkType>, <LinkLabel>, <LinkURL>, <IconPath>);

<table class="table table-striped">
<th>LinkType</th>
<th>Type of Link (see below)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>LinkLabel</td>
<td>Label to use for the link when displaying</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>LinkURL</td>
<td>URL of the link. You can use variables like <strong>$MODULE$</strong>
 and <strong>$RECORD$</strong> which will be replaced with the values of the current module and crmid</td>
