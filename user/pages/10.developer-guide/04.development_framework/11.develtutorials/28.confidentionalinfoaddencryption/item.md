These are the steps that need to be taken in order to implement a new
encryption/decryption method:

-   Add your new method to the switch case in encryptFields defining
    your encryption method function
-   Add your new method to the switch case in decryptFields defining
    your decryption method function
-   Add your new NONCE method to the switch case in getNONCE defining
    your method function to obtain the unique encryption code
-   Define the methods themselves following the code examples of the
    ones that already exist
-   Add your method to configuration
-   Add any functionality you may require
-   Check and adjust the migrate to new password method: most probably
    you will not have to do anything here
