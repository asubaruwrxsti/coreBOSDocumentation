From time to time it happens that you want to change the database you
are using in your installation. This is a developer situation as it is
very rare to want to do this in a production install, but the steps
below would work correctly also for a production coreBOS.

The situation is that we have a completely functional coreBOS connected
to some database. This database has been corrupted or simply contains
some obsolete image that we want to eliminate in order to recover a
different database to use with our code. Obviously, the database
contains meta information about users, modules and similar settings that
require synchronization with the code. That is why we must follow the
next steps every time we change the database:

Once deleted and recovered the new database we must:

-   set the config.inc.php or the config-dev.inc.php database access
    variables if their values have changed
-   execute build/HelperScripts/updatetabdata.php
-   execute build/HelperScripts/createuserfiles.php
-   execute build/HelperScripts/resetadminpw (if necessary)
-   login, go to the coreBOS updater module: load and apply all
    changesets
