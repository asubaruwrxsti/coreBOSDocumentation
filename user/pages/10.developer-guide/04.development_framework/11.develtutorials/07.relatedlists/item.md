the TLDR; version is

-   Relate with Documents &gt; get\_attachments
-   Relate with Calendar &gt; get\_activities
-   Relate with Emails &gt; get\_emails
-   Is custom relation &gt; whatever function you have implemented
-   1:m &gt; get\_dependents\_list
-   m:m &gt; get\_related\_list

How to associate Standard Modules such as Accounts, Potentials & Vendors to a New module (Payslip) with m:m relation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through vtlib we can establish a relation between a standard module and
a new one using the setRelatedList function:
```php
$accounts=Vtiger_Module::getInstance('Accounts');
$accounts->setRelatedList(Vtiger_Module::getInstance('Payslip'), 'header',Array('ADD','SELECT'))
```
this would establish a m:m relation between Accounts and Payslip so that
a new section will appear in the more information tab of accounts and
should just work.

You may have to add the 'header' label to the accounts language file.

This m:m relation is based on the get\_related\_list default function
(no function name was given in the example call so get\_related\_list
function is used by default) and the relation between accounts and
payslip will be saved in the vtiger\_crmentityrel database table.

This is vtlib 2.1 normal behavior.

How to associate Standard Modules such as Accounts, Potentials & Vendors to a New module (Payslip) with a 1:m relation. The old fashion way
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This works as follows: When you click on the +info tab of any entity,
the code goes into the vtiger\_relatedlist table in the database where
the information of what is related is. It extracts from this table, the
names of the related entities and the functions that need to be called
to get the list of related entities. These functions will be called
against the object representing the entity. For example,
```php
 $accounts->setRelatedList(Vtiger_Module::getInstance('Payslip'), 'header',Array('ADD'),'get_payslip');
```

will create an entry in the vtiger\_relatedlist indicating that the
get\_payslip() function should be called against an account object to
get it's related payslips. That is why the function must be added in
accounts. If you look in the vtiger\_relatedlists table you will see
that accounts is also related to contacts through the get\_contacts
function which can also be found in the accounts.php script.

So if we want to establish a new section in the +info tab based on a
relation that is not standard
(get\_related\_list()/vtiger\_crmentityrel), we **COULD** create our own
function inside that entity to retrieve the related elements based on
the relation we have established.

So if we add a new field to the payslip module of uitype 10 to capture
the related account. That means that we are forcing a 1:m relation, 1
account has m payslips, 1 payslip has one account (the one captured by
the uitype 10 field). This means that the vtiger\_payslip database table
has a new field called accountid where the relation between the modules
is being saved. As you see, the standard get\_related\_list() function
will not find this relation as it knows nothing about the fields you
have added (it looks for the relation in the vtiger\_crmentityrel
table), so we need to create our own new function that will retrieve the
records based on this uitype 10 field.

The best way to do this is to copy an existing function from another
module and modify the query, you really don't have to look at the other
lines of the function, all the get\_xxx functions are the same. You have
to change:

    *the name of the function, which has to be the same as the one you put in the setRelatedList() call
    *the name of the function in the two debug lines at the beginning and end of function. This isn't needed for it to work but may come in handy if you ever have to debug the script.
    *the query, to get the records you need<code>select vtiger_payslip.*, vtiger_crmentiy.* from vtiger_payslip

inner join vtiger\_crmentity.crmid=vtiger\_payslip.payslpiid left join
vtiger\_users.... left join vtiger\_group... ... where deleted=0 and
vtiger\_payslip.accountid = $id&lt;/code&gt;

In the case of the example a new get\_payslip() function must be added
to modules/Accounts/Accounts.php script

**NOTE**. This is the way to establish a **m:m relation** when you are
not using the standard vtiger\_crmentityrel table. For example, if you
wanted to show the entities related to a document or an activity which
use other tables to save their relations.

How to associate Standard Modules such as Accounts, Potentials & Vendors to a New module (Payslip) with a 1:m relation. The new vtlib way
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With vtlib we can now establish this relation easily. All we have to do
is add a uitype 10 capture field in the module with the 1 relation and
the use the special function get\_dependents\_list() to retrieve the
related entities. So if

So if we add a new field to the payslip module of uitype 10 to capture
the related account. That means that we are forcing a 1:m relation, 1
account has m payslips, 1 payslip has one account (the one captured by
the uitype 10 field). This means that the vtiger\_payslip database table
has a new field called accountid where the relation between the modules
is being saved. Now all we have to do is relate the account's payslips
with the setRelatedList function:
```php
    $accounts->setRelatedList(Vtiger_Module::getInstance('Payslip'), 'header',Array('ADD'),'get_dependents_list');
```
This is the correct way of establishing this relation. We will also get
an "Add" button on top of the related list that will preselect the
related entity automatically.

How to associate new modules with Activities â€“ Add To Do / Add Event
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To associate any module to Activities you cannot use the standard
get\_related function.

When you use the function setRelatedList(relatedmodule, header, actions,
function) and you don't specify the callback function, a generic
get\_related\_list function is called. This function expects to find a
many to many relation in the vtiger\_crementityrel table.

Activities does not establish it's relation in the vtiger\_crmentityrel
table, but in others, so you can't use the standard function, you have
to use the get\_activities function.

Activities is done like this:
```php
    setRelatedList(relatedmodule, header, actions, 'get_activities')
```
**BUT**, that means that your new module **MUST** have this function in
it's main file. You can do two things:

-   copy the get\_activities function from Accounts.php into
    data/CRMEntity.php, this way you will have it for all your modules
-   copy the get\_activities function from Accounts.php into your new
    module's main file. This will make your module distributable and
    easier to upgrade

You don't have to make any modifications to the get\_activities
function, it is the same for all modules. Which of the two choices
depends on the goal of the new module and the changes you are making.

How to associate new modules with Documents
-------------------------------------------

To associate any module to Documents you cannot use the standard
get\_related function.

When you use the function setRelatedList(relatedmodule, header, actions,
function) and you don't specify the callback function, a generic
get\_related\_list function is called. This function expects to find a
many to many relation in the vtiger\_crementityrel table.

Documents does not establish it's relation in the vtiger\_crmentityrel
table, but in others, so you can't use the standard function, you have
to use the get\_attachments function.

Documents is done like this:
```php
    setRelatedList(relatedmodule, header, actions, 'get_attachments')
```
How to associate new modules with Activities History
----------------------------------------------------

Similar to the above solution in this case you must use the already
existing coreBOS functions to achieve an event history.

Create a new related block:
```php
    setRelatedList('Calendar', 'Activity History', 'add', 'get_history')
```
Now copy the get\_history function from Accounts.php (for example) and
adapt accordingly (normally just change Accounts for your module)

Adding a related list to an existing module without modifying it's code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Since November 2014 the application has a way of adding related lists to
a module without having to modify its main class. [Read all about it on the hooks wiki page!](../20.corebos_hooks)

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

<div class="notices blue">
<h2>Why doesn't get_dependents_list support the SELECT button? </h2></div>

select is directly eliminated in get\_dependents\_list because that
action is dangerous and not supported

think about it

a get\_dependents\_list is a 1:N relation, so on the related list, you
are seeing those records that have a certain ID in their uitype 10. If I
am on an Account, and looking at the contacts related list, I am seeing
those contacts that have that accountid in their field. Select would
mean that we would have to **overwrite** that value for the selected
records, effectively **UNRELATING** them from the records they are
related to now. **That is dangerous** and probably NOT what the user
wants to do.

If it IS what you want to do you have to go to the module (contacts in
the example above) filter and mass edit the accountid field. So you can
"select" if you want, but you have to do it through mass edit. It must
be a conscious and intentional act, not an unintentional one.
