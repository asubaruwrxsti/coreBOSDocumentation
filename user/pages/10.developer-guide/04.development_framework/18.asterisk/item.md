How to simulate a call
----------------------

Activate PBX for the user you want to test with. In this example I set
extension 14 for admin user (userid=1):

    UPDATE `vtiger_asteriskextensions` SET `asterisk_extension`='14', `use_asterisk` = '1'
     WHERE `vtiger_asteriskextensions`.`userid` = 1;

Since we are making the change directly in the database, the user file
is not updated, so go to the users' preferences and click on the
"Recalculate" action.

Once you do that, reload the coreBOS page and open the inspector network
tab. You will see that asterisk.js has been loaded and that the polling
has started.

Now we insert a call directly in the DB:

    INSERT INTO `vtiger_asteriskincomingcalls`
     (`from_number`, `from_name`, `to_number`, `callertype`, `flag`, `timer`, `refuid`)
     VALUES
     ('03-3608-5660', 'joeb', '14', 'SIP', '0', UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), 'any_unique_id');

the important number here is the "14" which must match the extension we
set in the update above.

Now you should see the asterisk popup notification in the application.

FAQ

<div class="notices blue"><h2>Since the extension is polling, is there a way to reduce the number of events detected?</h2></div>

Configure your asterisk server with the next settings to filter
events by putting them in manager.conf (in freepbx it would be
manager\_custom.conf) (asterisk &gt;= 1.8):

    read = all
    write = all
    writetimeout = 2000
    eventfilter=!Event: DMTF
    eventfilter=!Event: RTCPSent
    eventfilter=!Event: RTCPReceived
    eventfilter=!Event: VarSet
    eventfilter=!Event: Cdr
    eventfilter=!Event: ExtensionStatus
    eventfilter=!Event: ChannelUpdate
    eventfilter=!Event: PeerStatus
    eventfilter=!Event: Registry

Since we applied this change the asteriskclient is much more stable.
